Project Programming for Data Analysis

Project Specifications:

​ Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
  collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
  
  - The chosen phenomenon was the incidence of cancer in males and females from 0-49 years.
  - 100,000 data points were simulated for each of four main variables.
  
  
• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.

- Cancer incidences per 100,000 were simulated using numpy's binomial function.
- The project compared the relationship between cancer incidence in male & female variables with age intervals from 0-49 years.
- It also examined the most common cancer types seen in these age intervals and compared cancer types in males and females.

• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

- The dataset was simulated using estimated probabilities from real data provided by Cancer Research UK.

• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
